# Building an LLM from Scratch

## Overview
This project aims to build a Language Model (LLM) from scratch, focusing on creating a decoder-only transformer architecture. The project is broken down into several key stages, including model design, pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. This README outlines the steps taken, the goals of the project, and provides a guide for replicating the process.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used for training and evaluation.
- `models/`: Directory where model checkpoints and configurations are saved.
- `src/`: Core codebase containing the implementation of the transformer model, data loaders, and training scripts.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for data processing, model evaluation, and other tasks.
- `README.md`: This document.

## Goals

1. **Understand LLMs from the Ground Up**: Building a decoder-only transformer to gain a deep understanding of the internal workings of LLMs.
2. **Pre-training**: Train the model on a large corpus to learn a broad understanding of language.
3. **Fine-tuning**: Adapt the pre-trained model to specific tasks or domains for better performance.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance on various benchmarks and compare it to existing models.

## Key Components

### 1. Decoder-Only Transformer
The project begins by implementing a decoder-only transformer architecture, which is a key component in modern language models like GPT.

### 2. Pre-training
Pre-training involves training the model on a large, diverse text corpus. This stage is crucial for the model to learn general language patterns, which can be fine-tuned for specific tasks later.

### 3. Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning takes the pre-trained model and adapts it to a specific task or dataset, enhancing its performance on that task.

### 4. Evaluation
Evaluation involves testing the model on various benchmarks to measure its performance and compare it against other models.
